    "## Response architecture models\n",
    "\n",
    "First, chatbots can be categorized according to how they generate the response that gets returned to the user. The simplest approach is the rule-based model, where chatbot responses are entirely predefined and returned to the user according to a series of rules. This includes decision trees that have a clear set of possible outputs defined for each step in the dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, there is the retrieval-based model, where chatbot responses are pulled from an existing corpus of dialogs. Machine learning models, such as statistical NLP models and sometimes supervised neural networks, are used to interpret the user input and determine the most fitting response to retrieve. Like rule-based models, retrieval-based models rely on predefined responses, but they have the additional ability to self-learn and improve their selection of response over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, generative chatbots are capable of formulating their own original responses based on user input, rather than relying on existing text. This involves the use of deep learning, such as LSTM-based seq2seq models, to train the chatbots to be able to make decisions about what is an appropriate response to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "While generative models are very flexible and powerful in that they are not confined to a predefined set of rules or responses, they are also significantly more challenging to implement. Training these chatbots require an abundance of data, and it is often unclear what gets used for their decision-making, making them more prone to grammatical errors and nonsensical replies. By contrast, retrieval-based models can guarantee the quality of the responses since they are predefined, but these chatbots are in turn restricted to language that exists within the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, chatbots often use a combination of the different models in order to produce optimal results. For example, a customer support chatbot may use generative models for creating open-ended small talk with the user, but then are able to retrieve professional, predefined responses for answering the user’s inquiries regarding the business or product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rule based chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based chatbots use regular expression patterns to match user input to human-like responses that simulate a conversation with a real person. For example, if a customer wanted to check the status of their KLM flight, they may have an interaction like below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utterance = user's statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent = chatbot's intepretation of user's statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity = information that a chatbot passes from a user statement to a triggered intent an entity – also referred to as a slot.\n",
