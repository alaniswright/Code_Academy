# The Chi-Square Statistic summarises how different 2 tables are.  
# The interpretation of the Chi-Square statistic is dependent on the size of the contingency table. For a 2x2 table (like the one weâ€™ve been investigating), a Chi-Square statistic larger than around 4 would strongly suggest an association between the variables. 
# calculate the chi squared statistic and save it as chi2, then print it:
